- 👋 Hi, I’m @JallaJenkins, formally known as Jason Stuart Leslie.
- 👀 I’m a former lawyer who just compeleted a PhD in law and I'm interested in a career change into software developement. I have an undergraduate honours degree in Mathemetica and Philosophy. After trying several different legal careers, I have decided to return to my love of everything mathematical and rigorously conceptual.
- 🌱 I have a decent knowledge of Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript as wekk as some familiarity with Jave. I'm currently learning C++ and Ruby on Rails. I'm also taking Introduction to Algoritms through MIT's OpenCourseWare. You will find several sample projects here in my repository including rachel-meditates (a website for my partner's meditation teaching actvitiees), qt_interactive_tableview_test_project (a small app testing Qt functionality), and CharacterRoller (a project in-progress to fully demonstrate my abilities with Python and Qt).
- 💞️ I’m looking to further develop my portfolio and find employment that will enable me to advance my career in software and coding. I am especially interested in helping out a small or medium-size legal sofrware company that could benefit from my outstanding acedemic credentials and decades of hands-on experience in the legal profession.
