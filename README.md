- 👋 Hi, I’m @JallaJenkins, formally known as Jason Stuart Leslie.

- 👀 I’m a former lawyer who just compeleted a PhD in law and I'm interested in a career change into software development. I have an undergraduate honours degree in Math and Philosophy. After trying several different legal careers, I have decided to return to my love of everything mathematical and rigorously conceptual.

- 🌱 I have a decent knowledge of Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript as well as some familiarity with Java and Lua. I'm currently learning C++ and Ruby on Rails. I'm also taking Introduction to Algorithms through MIT's OpenCourseWare. You will find several sample projects here in my repository including:
      - rachel-meditates (a website for my partner's meditation teaching activities),
      - qt_interactive_tableview_test_project (a small app testing Qt functionality), and 
      - CharacterRoller (a project in-progress to fully demonstrate my abilities with Python and Qt).

- 💞️ I’m looking to further develop my portfolio and find employment that will enable me to advance my career in software and coding. I am especially interested in helping out a small or medium-size legal software company that could benefit from my outstanding academic and professional credentials and decades of hands-on experience throughout the legal community.
